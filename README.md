# Stock Price Prediction Dashboard

## 1. Introduction

The **Stock Price Prediction Dashboard** is a comprehensive web application aimed at predicting stock prices using machine learning models. It is designed to provide users with an interactive interface for analyzing stock prices and making predictions based on historical data. The project utilizes Python and Streamlit to offer a user-friendly experience.

## 2. Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- To develop an interactive dashboard for visualizing and predicting stock prices.
- To implement and compare different machine learning models for stock price prediction.
- To provide a tool that can assist users in making informed investment decisions.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Interactive Dashboard
- Built with Streamlit to ensure a seamless user experience.
- Provides real-time interaction for stock data analysis.

### 3.2 Stock Data Visualization
- Displays historical stock prices.
- Visualizes predicted prices based on selected models.

### 3.3 Machine Learning Models
- Implements various models to predict future stock prices, including Linear Regression and LSTM Neural Networks.

### 3.4 User Input
- Allows users to input stock tickers for real-time analysis and prediction.

## 4. Usage

### 4.1 Input Stock Ticker
- Navigate to the input section of the dashboard and enter the stock ticker symbol for the stock you want to analyze.

### 4.2 View Historical Data
- The dashboard will display the historical stock prices for the entered ticker.

### 4.3 Predict Future Prices
- The machine learning model will predict future stock prices based on the historical data provided.

## 5. Model Description

### 5.1 Linear Regression
- A simple yet powerful model that assumes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable.

### 5.2 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network
- A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies, particularly useful for time series prediction.

## 6. Data Sources
- The historical stock price data is sourced from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance Python library. This ensures reliable and up-to-date financial data for analysis and prediction.

## 7. Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- streamlit
- yfinance
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow (for LSTM model)

## 8. Future Work

### 8.1 Model Improvement
- Experiment with more advanced models to improve prediction accuracy.
- Fine-tune existing models to enhance performance.

### 8.2 Additional Features
- Add functionalities such as news sentiment analysis and technical indicators to provide more comprehensive stock analysis.
- Incorporate user authentication and personalized dashboards.

#### 8.3 Deployment
- Deploy the application on a cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku for wider accessibility and scalability.
